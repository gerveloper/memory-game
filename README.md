> HTML, CSS & JS practice

#### [WATCH IT DEPLOYED HERE!](https://gerveloper.github.io/memory-game/ "WATCH IT DEPLOYED HERE!")
------------

In this practice I employed **HTML**,  **CSS** and **JS** to create a simple memory game. 

## What I worked with:

-   **HTML** to create the divs for the score output as well as to create the grid for the cards;
-   **CSS**  to define the size of the divs, basically;
-   **JS**  to iterate and create the borad, to flip the cards, to check for matches and if there is one, to move the cards out of the board. Also, I used it keep the score and to show the messages.

## How to play:

Really easy! Just click on any card so it flips and then try to find the correct match for it by clicking some other card. Once you find it, the two cards will disappear. Every time you make a match, a message will show (if you are not from Argentina, you can look it up on Google; if you are, you will instantly know... In either case, good luck trying to stop humming it. Sorry. :P).
